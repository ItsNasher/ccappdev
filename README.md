 # Guide
 1. Download File
 2. Find the location of package.json
 3. `npm install` to download dependencies
    
 ## Login Register
 - Sessions (so that log out works, and the site remembers who is logged on)
 
 ## Main Forum
 - Do the whole thing
   
 ## Create Post (including tag filters)
 - ~~Allow uploading of video links~~
 - ~~(make post button grey out when switching between tabs, make the content-box be required so theres an alert)~~
 - ~~tested out adding text/image/link to content and then switching to see if the upload will work. It works if its switching tabs to images or videos, but if its text it doesnt. Also example: title: aa text: aa --switch-->  image: randomimg.jpg (post created succsefully! posted the image in the db). Doesn't work if its image and video towards text tho.~~
 - (difficult) store selected tags in db for future forum use
 - ~~Link the made posts in the db to the feed~~
